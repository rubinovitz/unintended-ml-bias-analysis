       "41923     It's interesting that this IP feels they know me so well, when I have had limited interaction with you.  We have never actively engaged each other on talk pages.  It's amazing you somehow have been able to edit every page I edit; every photograph you crop is mine.  Have you wondered where this ire against me and my work has come from?  You continually put a photo of a man in a wig (a photoshopped wig, at that) on the Afro page, and four different editors have removed it, five if you include me.  This is what you consider ownership and edit warring?  Then you have taken my photographs and decided to rename them simply to remove David Shankbone out of the file name.  Your intentions are no pure.  You are gaming the policies and guidelines to Wikistalk me.  You say not to bite the newcomers, but I haven't actively engaged you.  If you are a newcomer, how come you have such a handy knowledge of Wiki policies and guidelines?  Why is every page in your history one I have contributed to...   \n",

I'm a postgraduate student from Ca' Foscari University, Venice. As an assignement for my History of English Culture course I have chosen to expand this article.  As a provisional bibliography I have selected these sources: Tim Hitchcock and Robert Shoemaker, Tales from the Hanging Court, London, Hodder Arnold, 2007  www.oldbaileyonline.org If you have any suggestions or advice, I would really appreciate it.

You are correct, so it's a good thing the original version didn't claim that ``current flows``!  Also, the phrase ``charge is made to flow into the capacitor`` isn't really accurate, as overall, charge neither leaves nor enters the capacitor.  Regards,  `   \n",

Exploiting tiny differences in the density of water of different temperatures would be a very inefficient way of producing power.  The only ways I know of that produce significant amounts of power from cold water are hydroelectric power (dams), tidal power, wave power, and power from ocean currents (analogous to wind power). Each of these involves falling water or water that is moving somewhat rapidly.         \n",
