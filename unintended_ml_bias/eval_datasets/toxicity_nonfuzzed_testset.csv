The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.  It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding.

4982099,"`  == More discussion of changes ==  Here's a few excerpts from the article that I'd like to visit:  1. ``Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed``  There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used ``the`` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably elite Protestant clergy`` (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.  I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:  :a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area. :b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him. :c. i. Whether the term ``fashionably elite`` is remotely relevant to the article. :c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.   2. ``the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised`` is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:  ``that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.``   3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.``  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions: 1. ``earliest`` be quantified to a given year, and ``Christian`` quanitified to a sect of the time. 2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's ``The World and the Prophets,`` which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies: :``Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known.`` (page 55) :``The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'`` (page 55)   4. ``Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body``, like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.``  The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:  ``The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body,`` like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.``   5. ``He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.``  I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:  ``As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.``  (As a side note, the phrase ``especially in the region of the country where Mormo",False

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called ``Race laws`` of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.  :::Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.  :::What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)  :::So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)  :::The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (``they killed Jesus``). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!  :::Now move along to 1297 and ``bingo!`` = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in ``ethnic cleansing`` by wholesale murder and mayhem.  :::Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)  :::The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say ``me too`` (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  `",False

Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the ``Israelites`` and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:  * Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article. * Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews. * Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article. * Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article * Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited * Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion. * Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited * Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism * Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links * British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism  I am open to discussion on these, but do read through the article first.

10411449,"`Certain none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges.  The term ``mukim`` was certain the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore.On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus.  In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.  :If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained.   Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.  :And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.   Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins.   From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  -   : Considering that ``Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term ``belief`` was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed ``evolutionist bias`` you claim is on the Creationism page.    -  ``Personal bias``?  Nope.  I have b",False

Finally, I don't see mentioning Pilz is Jewish to be controversial at all.  Iran's official response to this still unsubstantiated allegation has been that it is part of a Zionist media smear campaign.  Therefore, how could you say that the fact the Pilz is Jewish is irrelevant?  I see it as quite relevant.  I also don't see why mentioning a Jewish person is Jewish should be viewed as controversial even in normal course of events and contexts.  Really bizarre.   `",False
18692184,"`  ::Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including ``Jewish`` at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to ``single out`` Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' ``early anouncements``,  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his ``extraordinarily reliable Agent D`` report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary ``contributors`` to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an ``interest`` on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  `",False

19504662,"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN. The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief. Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran. There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD!   Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.  Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism.

However, I would like to say that I have no desire to deceive Muslims, Christians or anyone else about my name in order to benefit my self. Rather, I have chosen my name for the following reasons.  Reason #1 After I left Egypt, I went to South Africa and was discipled in Christ there. When I began ministering to Muslims in South Africa, I became very well known by my Muslim name. For four years radical Muslims pursued me diligently. I had to hide all the time and change my residency from one city to another almost on a monthly basis. When I wrote my first book in South Africa, my pastor and I discussed whether I should put my name on it. We decided to change my name for security reasons.  Reason #2 I was not comfortable living my Christianity by a Muslim name. I felt my Muslim name was part of my old man. When a person called me by that  name, it reminded me of my old life. I want to live by a Christian name.  Choice of name I chose the first name of Mark because Mark was a writer of the Gospels. Mark was also the first Christian who went to Egypt with the Good News. When Jesus sent the seventy out from Jerusalem, Mark brought the gospel to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. I chose the last name of Gabriel because Gabriel was the angel who brought the good news of the coming of the Messiah to the virgin Mary. Also this was the name of the first Christian person I met in South Africa who took me into his home and invited me to his church.

Church statistics are more accurate than most other denomination's ``estimates`` and the computer system designates and distinguishes quite easily.

Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the ``other``. Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all ``conservative`` churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing).

The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.  As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.  Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.  Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their ``Nationalist`` and ``New Nation`` magazines, the ``Nationalist Educational Association`` and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward`` was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.  In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.    After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.  Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the ``Nationalist`` magazine, and he preached what he called ``military socialism.``  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.  The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the ``Wholecaust`` (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers' ",False

I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes ``keep`` for anything with the word ``Jewish`` in it; nor am I an editor who votes ``delete`` whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).  :I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a ``criteria for speedy deletion`` that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.  :But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating ``Jewish Foo`` lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted ``delete`` on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.  :There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.  :If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.

As to arbitration: well, it sounds nice in theory, but I worry the actual good it'd do and how I'd probably be the one to get smacked down. At the risk of sounding, er, slightly paranoid, my style apparently makes me a magnet for All Bad Things and there is not much I can do about it. It seems as if Dominick can do and say anything, repeatedly, and nothing happens, but I get admonished (or blocked!) for sarcasm and things I didn't even do.   While I was blocked (which incident is forgiven): in the ``external links`` section at the entry ``Rosary,`` he replaced this link with this one, calling the former a ``monograph site`` (by which he means, apparently, that there is one person who oversees thing  even though I have SIX people and he has been informed of this. If there's anything in the rules about monographs, I'd like to see what the heck Dominick is talking about). Malachias111 (my ``meatpuppet``) had my back, but man, oh, man!  I just want for him to leave me ALONE, to quit libelling me and my life's work, and to stop taking down perfectly relevant, helpful, and informative links just because he hates traditional Catholicism. Dominick is a ``POV Warrior`` with a a neo-conservative Catholic POV who engages in harrassment and a soft form of ``vandalism`` (though I don't think his purpose is to imperil the integrity of the encyclopedia, he is removing perfectly good content for no good reason  and lying about that content in the process). If he wants to go through and put the line ``a traditional Catholic website`` after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.  If you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation.   I will try to be more civil as it is apparently defined, but if it weren't for sarcasm, I don't know how I'd survive this stuff.

31930731,"`  :Daniel 9:24-27 Daniel tells of the comming of the messiah Jesus. This was a prophecy and the Magi or wise men read the prophecy and identified the Mesiah well in advance. This proves that for men of faith prophecy is fact not mere speculation. Jesus told Thomas, ``more blessed is he that belives without first seeing``. I have posted an article by Pastor David Bay for you to read which explains in detail the prophecy of Jesus's comming.  THE UNPARALLELED PRECISE PROPHECY  Daniel 9:24-26, ``Seventy weeks of years, or 490 years are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city Jerusalem, to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint a holy of holies. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the coming of the anointed one, a prince, shall be seven weeks of years, and sixty-two weeks of years; it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times. And after the 62 weeks of years, shall the anointed one be cut off (killed) and shall have nothing and no one belonging to and defending Him...``  The remaining one week is found in verse 27, and refers to the last seven years of earth's history, the period which we know as the ``Great Tribulation``.  The term ``Weeks of Years`` was a common Jewish term. It meant literally seven (7) years. The term comes from God's commandment in Leviticus 25:3-4 to farm a piece of land for only six years, allowing it to lie fallow for the seventh. This seven-year period came to be known as a ``week of years``. Therefore, Seventy Weeks of Years was 490 Hebrew years.  Note this prophecy contains three parts:      1. 7 Weeks of Years (49 Hebrew Years)      2. 62 Weeks of Years (434 Hebrew Years)      3. 1 Week of Years (7 Hebrew Years)  At the precise point in history when the 7 + 62 Weeks of Years occurred, Israel could expect Messiah to announce Himself as Messiah. What great news! This means that Israel could not miss Messiah. All they had to do was to count, be cognizant of current events in Israel as they unfolded, and be aware of this prophecy.  This study will show us several things:      1. Why the Wise Men knew the time for Messiah was close.      2. Why Israel missed Messiah.      3. How this applies to us today.  Let us now consider the meaning of the prophecy.  I. The Duration of the Prophecy  This prophecy stipulated that Messiah would be presented to Israel and would be killed after 69 weeks of years had elapsed from the specified starting point. When we multiply 69 times 7, we understand that the time involved here equals 483 Jewish years. Since the Jewish calendar contains 360 days, we can easily see that God is talking about 173,880 days. Therefore, we can expect that 173,880 days after the prophecy started, the Messiah would present Himself to Israel as Messiah-King.  II. The Starting Point of the Prophecy (Daniel 9:25a)  In this verse , God said the prophecy would begin ``from the going forth (the issuing) of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem...`` At the time God gave Daniel this prophecy, Israel was a slave nation under Babylon; however, God had foretold that this slavery would last only 70 years. This 70-year period was rapidly coming to a close; indeed, non-Jewish history records that the Medo-Persian emperor Artaxerxes issued such a decree on March 14, 445 B.C. Therefore, precisely 173,880 days from this day should bring us to some significant event in Jesus' life which presented Him to the nation Israel as Messiah.  III. The Mathematics Of The Prophecy  A. The First Seven Weeks (49 Jewish Years)  If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will find the account of the Jewish pilgrimage to rebuild Jerusalem following King Artaxerxes' decree. The prophet Nehemiah assumed charge of this rebuilding effort, which was carried out in such extreme hardship and danger that the builders carried swords with them as they were building the walls. Thus was fulfilled precisely the prophecy in verse 25b,``...it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times.``  This effort began in 445 B.C. and culminated in 396 B.C., exactly 49 years, just as foretold.  B. The Second Period (62 Weeks of Years, 434 years)  Daniel 9:26 foretells that the ``anointed One`` would come after this period and would then be killed. This wording is understood by most conservative scholars to refer to Jesus Christ, not at His birth, but at His presentation as the Messiah-Prince. (2) ``",False

35064257,"` Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.  Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.  ==Biography and music career== ===Early life and discovery=== Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song ``And They Call the Wind Maria``, from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.  Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.  In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.  ===1990–1992: Early commercial success=== Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career. The album debuted low on t",False

Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like ``Boss`` and ``roman`` , now? heh, heh, heh)  Reply:   2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.  Reply:   3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my ``mate``. Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…  Reply:   4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the ``Roman`` you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.  Reply:  5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong  Reply:  6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context.   Reply:  7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings?

You would have to show direct quotes, direct cause and effect between the 1. rejection by KJVO (Abreviated as KJVO on this page for the sake of brevity) of the modern versions 2. their own explanations of their rejections of modern versions BECAUSE they are officially endorsed by ``mainstream`` Protestant denominations.   However, even if you could find such explanations in passing, the reason why KJVOs reject Modern versions is because the Modern Versions are innacurate, NOT because the official versions are endorsed by ``mainstream`` Protestant denominations. Most KJVOs would not care who endorsed a particular version, if their own conclusions were that the Version in question were accurate. Therefore to suggest that   ``In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by ``mainstream`` Protestant denominations``.  implies a cause and effect relationship between the conclusions of the KJVOs and the basis upon which that reasoning was made, which is faulty.

37144574,"`IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==  I would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister.   The genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans.   Mind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.  Genetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians.   The article that is basically claiming that Kurds are closer to Jewish populations than Iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community.  ==`",False

49738070,"`  == A hit list for Jews == There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in ``keeping an eye on Jewish activities``.  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.  The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.  Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.  Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the ``real Jews``.  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.  Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.`",False

Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a ``free pass`` when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi.

54773513,"`  == Request opinion of Muslim editor ==  Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say ``Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers.`` Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying ``Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,`` which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic?

However, the debate still rages fiercely - I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phone-in, and it would crop up all the time. As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",False
67210547,"`::: Monkeykiss, Stephen I agree with you. I will ad the socio-political implications in the main section. In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible. Thus its imperative to ``THINK`` before acting. There is no gain in regretting/praying later. Your opinion pls? with metta   `",False

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women.   Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006     A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building.   “Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.”   Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building.   In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist.   Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.”   In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence.   In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building.   “This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.”   As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.”   Worship Rights    In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building.   The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock.   “Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.”   The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the",False

You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally ``biased`` ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word ``intact``, which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this?

In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions.   Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.  Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.  In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me ``extra work``. I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)  I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name ``Evilbu``. Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the ``Flemish language`` really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like ``septant`` rather than ``soixant-dix`` for ``seventy``, etc). Also, you said something about you ``being too young``. You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're ``not a Zionist``. That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.  But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to ``sell`` our religion to anyone else.  The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally ``interfaith`` manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.

Since its inception, Spring Harvest has had a profound impact on the life of the Church in the UK, and further afield.  It has encouraged new styles of worship. It has exposed Christians to a vast range of speakers and Church leaders from all over the world.

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: ``International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and ``Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group``. Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression ``telephone centrals`` instead of ``exchanges`` is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange.

The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, ``many`` is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (``my way is the correct one`` type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using ``many`` or ``most`` or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that ``many`` do (I wouldn't even object to ``almost all`` or ``most``), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!  `",False

Shaikh noticed Hassan's intelligence and sent him to memorize the Qur'an early in childhood. Hassan memorized the entire Qur'an. He was known for being very articulate as he gave sermons in Mosques at a young age. ::* Four years earlier than his peers, Hassan attended Mosque of Al-Azhar at the age of 16 where he graduated as the first in his class. He refused a scholarship opportunity from The Ministry of Education in Europe.  === ODESSA ===  ::* Hassan al Banna was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and wrote supportive letters to Hitler. Hassan was solicited by Nazi intelligence when Hitler rose to power In the 1930's. He established a Nazi Germany spy network throughout the Arabian Peninsula for Hitler. Al Banna promised Hitler that when Gen. Rommel's panzer division arrived in Cairo and Alexandria, the Muslim Brotherhood would ensure that all of the British troops would be killed.  :::This was removed by an anonymous editor with the claim that it is unproven non-sense. 30 June 2005 02:29 (UTC)  === Coffee Houses Comment === Can anyone verify the comment that Coffee houses were ``morally suspect``?

Please signal your position regarding this communiqué.        -The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns.     -An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain.     -Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less.     -The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka. This means the celebration of British Bangladeshi’s born and bought up in the UK as well, such as Rabina Khan and Abdul Ahad.      -DP to become a genuine human rights organisation. This means concentration on bread and butter issues such as providing clean drinking water, inoculation and freedom from corruption and not 101 blog posts about the Awami League and the upcoming (irrelelevant) elections in Bangladesh.

There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German.

This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The ``a million`` is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.  *In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the ``Eastern German territories`` and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.  ::The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.  *If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing.

What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”.

You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.  *It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.  ::If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities.

I understand there is much strif between modern Greeks and Macedonians about ancient culture in the balkan region today, but we must look at the facts, especially in articles which are being viewed by millions of people. The fact that Aristotle taught another Macedonian, Alexander the Great, makes their relationship a very logical one, especially since Aristotle's father had previously served the Macedonian rulers in the past, it is only fitting that the king of Macedonia, King Philip, would trust Aristotle to teach his son.

Then Christian Death turned it upside down.  History Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.  Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up  Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor. Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.  Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”. Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future.   After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.  1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.  1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.  In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.  Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",False

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

It seems to me that he's explaining his method directly to Borden as he was dying.  He tells Borden to ``look where you are`` and ``it takes courage to walk in every night not knowing whether I was going to be the prestige or the man in the box`` (paraphrasing).  Obviously, he doesn't play a video to Borden showing him exactly what we, the audience see, but it was pretty clear to me that these clips were meant to be explanatory not only to the audience, but in a sense to Borden as well.  The phrasing (included below) makes it sound like Borden never finds out how Angier did the trick.  ``Similarly, flashbacks recount (only to the audience) Angier's method: that each time he disappeared during his illusion, he fell into a locked tank and drowned, and the machine created a duplicate who teleported to the balcony and basked in the applause.``  Also, having just watched the film again, it seems to me that Cutter colludes with Borden to allow Borden in to kill Angier so that Angier can re-unite with his daughter (who he earlier recommends that she ``needs her father.``)  Cutter leaves ``Lord Caldlow's`` estate disgusted, as he has stolen Borden's daughter and helped frame him for murder.  I assume that he resolved to help Fallon/Borden to get his daughter back after finding out that Lord Caldlow was really Angier.  Thoughts?     The ending of the film Angier is still alvie.

For what? If there is an air bubble it's probably because Jackman needed to breathe...   :The air bubble is real; I saw it twice in the theater and on DVD.  I can upload a screen shot from the DVD with the air bubble if necessary.  The point is, other editors have argued that this doesn't mean anything, however what bothers me is this: the Nolan's are really good at what they do.  If we saw the air bubble, then you can bet they saw it, and if it was a mistake, it would have been digitally removed.  The fact that they left it in the film is very interesting, and nicely parallels the end of the novel itself.  On the other hand, it doesn't make sense.  The Angier floating in the tank is clearly dead and has no way of getting out. — |    == Plot Ending == In the plot description of this page it states that the film ends with Borden eyeing the water traps containing the dead duplicates of Angier. However, when I saw the film (and I may be mistaken in this) it seemed as if the trap shown immediately before the credits contained a living Angier. This fact was further emphasized when the camera panned away from the burning theatre and to the body of Angier, which had wide open eyes and appeared to be viewing the scene that had just occurred between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the credits roled immediately after he came into full view (only showing the body for a second). It may also be that the director included this to leave the audience guessing as to whether or not the body was alive or not and whether Angier did in fact have the last laugh. Either way, a reference to this should be included into the Plot Summary.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    :Keep in mind that like most Nolan films, the film is non-linear, so the plot summary synthesizes in many areas, including the conclusion.

167861227,"`  Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view.   == Background == Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements.   As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as ``fanboys.`` Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.  The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of ``teenybopper``.  ==History of fanboys and the term== The term ``fanboy`` is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.   Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.  The earliest published uses of the word ``fanboy`` have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the ``Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide``.  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state ``Fanboys of America,`` who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.  Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's ``Fandom Confidential`` comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into ``mindless paroxysms of adoration.``  The John Byrne character responded that they were ``a couple of fanboys in bondage`` (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called ``Gay Boys in Bondage``. http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by ``Ambush Bug`` to a letter in his comic in 1985.  ==Media== ===Comic Book=== *Sergio Aragonés' Fanboy *Galactic Storm       Fanboy  ===Television=== *The Simpsons'''s Comic Book Guy refers to himself as a fanboy. *Freakazoid'''s Fan Boy  ===Radio/",False

172104686,"This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading, because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry, in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest, and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.

According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.  When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994). check this:http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Arvanitika or this http://www.traboini.com/al/public_02.html or ARVANITET By Irakli Kocollari Reviewed by Dr. Arben Kallamata    If u are Arvanit than translate this,my grandpa used to sing it to me:Moj e bukura Moré, si të lash më s´të pashë, si të lash, si të lash, si të lash më s´të pashë...  rri o laman se sje Arvanit ti po ik e shkërdheu me gjith Grek!

The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance.

The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

Therefore, blocking me (on trumped-up Wikipedia ``charges``) does not bother me in the least. However, it is a sad reflection on your own processes. Why?   (1) Administrative editors specifically deleted my (concise) position statement in the RfC section and supplanted it with their own statement in an attempt to influence the RfC. These Administrators of Wikipedia were simultaneously advocating a particular viewpoint on O'Loughlin's work, and judging the validly of a contributing editor's references and attempting to silence him.   (2) The repeated deleting by Wikipedia editors of the words ``media monitoring groups`` and substituting it with the words ``Jewish groups`` (when they are by no means exclusively Jewish) will be of general wider interest, I think, and may have certain other implications.

Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people   ``Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced`` This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:   Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org. During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.  Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.  As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.  The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book ``Historical Sight Through Thesprotia``, edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that ``The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek`` .  The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.  On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.  During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",False

The persian spelling is originally from Ilkhanid times and we see diverse spelling like Airavan, Irevan, Erevan and much more. The spelling used by EI is one I adopted. I thought it would be easy just to say Yerevan, but seems people are upset.

What Prashad is actually addressing here (and in other writings) is his opposition to Hindu nationalists in India and their developing relationship to Jewish Lobby groups as well as to the Likud. Prashad's discussion is not scholarly, it is purely polemical, and he is attempting to minimize the influence of the lobby in order to undercut the Hindu right wing's alliance with them and with (at the time) Sharon. Elsewhere, Prashad, an intellectual leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, has argued that the Jewish Lobby cant be powerful because to think so ``does not sit well for a Marxist framework.`` Hence Prashad has been arguing that the strength of Sharonism is what's key in US support for Israel, not the JL. Given the polemical character of Prahshad's piece and it's peripheral relationship to the actual history of the JL, and the fact that his quote is lifted out of context from what he is actually discussing/polemicizing presenting (the CPI-M line), and regardless of what one makes of his argument, this is way too weighty.   `",False

Charlesworth has written that ``Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E.`` [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that ``We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place.`` On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: ``It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world.`` [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:        The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!  Finally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:  ``I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.``  ``...he argues mainly from silence.``  ``...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.``    ``(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.``  None of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the ``Jesus-myth`` consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.  Again, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them.  `",False

215904457,"  No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.  The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.  But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance.   If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.  It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.  The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.  Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.  (1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.  (2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.  (3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.  (4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.  (5) Introducing matrix algebra.  (6) Quoting Feynam.  We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.  The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you. You much prefer that big mindless waffle of an introduction that tells us absolutely nothing about centrifugal force.   ",False

May I point out that Malaysia and Indonesia, which are described as Muslim countries (as they officially indeed are), contain very substantial Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. (See the CIA World Fact Book .) Moreover, many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region. North Borneo and New Guinea, for example, are very large geographical areas in Malaysia and Indonesia which only have a marginal Muslim presence; the Moluccas in Indonesia are at least 50% Christian; Bali is famously Hindu. Overall, Malaysia is some 60% Muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus-80% circumcised category as it appears on the map. But given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the Indonesian Archipelago, it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way.

229798640,"`   I copy this from comfort women pages. It contains many references.  Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.  From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006   'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'  The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, ``In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words ``comfort women`` are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966.   In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as ``yanggongju`` or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.  In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual ``yanggalbo`` (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent.   Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?  Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who ``applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley``.  Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.  It says. ``Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who ``serve`` the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.``   Priorend  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   `",False

I think this article should be worded more like the homosexuality article, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation and same-sex relationships.  Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender.  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.  On the other hand, the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation.  That crucial element isn't clear.

On the second occasion,  at least had the common courtesy to follow policy and provide an edit summary. Since the article was my contribution, and since I feel that Wikipedia should include an article on this subject, I am responding here.  The edit summary states: ``This page is nothing but WP:OR. There is no ``fallacy``. Best as a redirect``  The last point might have force if use/mention fallacies were defined on the redirect page, but they are not. Indeed, they are not mentioned at all. Furthermore, I can make no sense of the second point. Interpreted as ``there is no such recognised thing as a use/mention fallacy`` it is obviously false, as can easily be shown by a google search (=use mention fallacy). The first ten results alone include citable examples dating back more than three decades. (Specifically, John R Searle's December 1976 review of ``Toward a Linguistic Theory of Speech Acts`` by Jerrold M Sadock in Language: ``There seems to me to be several massive use-mention fallacies in this .... But this has the effect of building a persistent use-mention fallacy into ...``) I don't want to insult Snalwibma's intelligence by implying he or she didn't bother to try this search, but I can't otherwise understand the criticism.  I'm less sure of my ground when it comes to the allegation of WP:OR. The example isn't mine, but I got it from the oral tradition (and changed 'nigger' to 'honky', mainly because I'm white myself), so can't cite anything to justify it. But I don't accept that inventing illustrative examples counts as WP:OR. If it did, the consequences for Wikipedia would be unfortunate, for whereas it might just be possible to quote a citable definition under fair use of copyright, quoting copyrighted examples is surely not on. So contributors must invent them if we are avoid an encyclopedia of merely abstract prose that only makes sense if you already know what it means.

Thanks,       ==New policy proposal and draft help==  Wikipedia:Scientific standards  I have drafted a new proposal and would like help in clarifying, adjusting, adapting, and improving it. It is based on five years of work here at Wikipedia (not always the prettiest, I might add). I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between WP:NPOV and WP:RS for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.  Note that these standards would apply only when discussing matters directly related to observable reality. These standards are inspired in part by WP:SPOV but avoid some of the major pitfalls of that particular proposal. In particular, the idea that SPOV even exists is a real problem. However, I think it is undeniable that we should have some standards for writing about scientific topics.  See also WP:SCI for another failed proposal that dovetails with this one. I hope this particular proposal is more in-line with the hole I see in policy/guidelines for dealing with these situations.      I have added a section that I think necessary for balance. I doubt you will like it, but I think it necessary to express the rue meaning of POV. I have not yet attempted to harmonize it with the discordant elements in some of the previous sections, some of which I consider rather clearly remarkable violations of NPOV, pojectivity, and the way i think a properly skeptical scientist looks at the world.   '    :Actually, I find nothing wrong with the content of what you are writing and essentially I think the same thing. One bit I do find strange is this ``primary approach`` issue. My idea is the following:  #A religious/philosophical/spiritual/metaphysical/etc. article should discuss all ideas about a subject relevant to the main approach to the article. Virgin Mary is the Christian ideas about the Virgin Mary; Reincarnation is about the various reincarnation-believing groups' approach to reincarnation and so on.  #Most ideas are utterly irrelevant to science because they will deal with things other than observable reality #If and when such an article happens in the natural course of development to discuss a particular idea that is contradicted by or is supported by scientific evidence, the idea is first presented from the perspective of the main approach to the article.  #Issues which have scientific evidence should have the scientific evidence that is directly relevant to the issue and nothing more. The evidence should be presented simply and straightforwardly without attempts to exaggerate, inflate, marginalize, or eliminate it. #Article continues on, unaffected by the scientific evidence presented.  :That's what I envision.

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:``Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli`` (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.  I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: ``Chapter 14: ``The Ends of the Universe,`` with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here``. Whereas the version before was properly cited: ``David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: ``The Ends of the Universe,`` with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.``  As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.  Additionally, while Jeffro77's ``fringe`` claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.  As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, ``The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,`` Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

259562376,"` ==on the Creator== :The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from ``something``. Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.    Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the ``concept of God`` uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.   `",False

266830155,"`Scylla]]  Summary of Scylla Scylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it. What makes it a Good Story? The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.  3 Latin Words to Describe Scylla Malus-evil Miser- wretched/sad Aliquid miri- something extraordinary  The Insight that the Myth Affords Into The Ancient World This myth does not show us a lot about the ancient world as it is a myth and so does not show a representation of the real world then. It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.   ===Other=== In a late Greek myth,Recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron. it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.    According to John TzetzesTzetzes, Ad Lycophron 45. and Servius' commentary on the AeneidServius on Aeneid iii. 420. Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but Amphitrite turned her into a monster.   It is said that by the time Aeneas' fleet came through the strait after the fall of Troy, Scylla had been changed into a dangerous rock outcropping which still stands there to this day.  The character of Sin from John Milton's Paradise Lost is similar to Scylla. Scylla and Charybdis are actually mentioned at one point in the poem.  ==Notes==   ==See also== *Scylla and Charybdis  ==References== *Hanfmann, George M.

He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that ``he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2``. Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. ``Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2`` This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. ``Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2`` he suggested.  The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, ``effective`` rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.  Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?  “Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des",False

279623291,"` is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the ``al'Buraq wall`` is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.     :Yes, its a point of contention. See above, it is discussed both in the ``Lead`` subsection of the ``POV Issues`` section and in the ``Rashid Khalidi`` section.    ==Jordanian occupation 1948–1967== I was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed.    :The answer is in the article.   ::It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.    Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank. Which is under occupation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     :::Jerusalem is viewed differently from the West Bank.

The Laides themselves denied this, and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual.  Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians.  We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past.  In previous eras in history, it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today. Indeed, same-gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship (but without any sexual content). This was known as ``romantic friendship``. However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is ``gay`` and what is ``straight``. In some ways, our modern society is very insecure in terms of sexuality.`",False

294581479,"`Married to the MOB, also known as MTTM or simply MOB, is a women’s streetwear clothing line started by Leah McSweeney in 2004.  The line is inspired by New York streets and clubs and rocks a chic, but not-to-be-messed with attitude that attracts style-confident females everywhere.  ==Leah McSweeney==   Leah McSweeney (born in 1982 in New York City) is founder and CEO of the successful female Married to the MOB clothing line.  Her early years were spent in New York City until she was thrown out in eighth grade from an all girls catholic school, Convent of the Sacred Heart, whose alumni include Lady Gaga and the Hilton Sisters.  Afterwards, Leah’s family moved to Newtown, Connecticut where she ran away every weekend to get back to her NYC roots.  Once Leah finished high school, she moved back to the Big Apple and went to the Fashion Institute of Technology for one week before calling it quits.   Tired of seeing guys having the coolest gear and brands, Leah had the brilliant idea of creating her own female clothing line , Married to the MOB, in 2004. Leah used her settlement of $75,000 (from a law suit stemming from a police officer attack) to jumpstart her idea and bought an Apple computer and painted her Spring Street apartment walls pink.   Leah’s apartment became the Married to the MOB headquarters; everyone from Leah's model sister and MOB poster girl Sarah McSweeney to her teenage friend Tabatha McGurr, daughter of well-known graffiti artist Futura 2000, became part of the crew.  The clothing line grew from there, and Leah switched her headquarters to the Empire State Building.    McSweeney has been included in a multitude of publications, such as [Elle Girl], [Inked (magazine)], [Complex (magazine)], [Elle (magazine)], [Vogue (magazine)], Hypebeast magazine, Format magazine, [Essence (magazine)], Paper magazine, Urb magazine, Teen Vogue, and Nylon magazine.  ==MTTM Collaborations and Beyond==    The bold statements on its graphic tees such as ``Supreme Bitch`` or ``New York needs Peter Gatien” have become the brand's trademark. Even the tagline “Men are the new women” from a MOB campaign was even used in conjunction with the tv show Big Shots (TV series). Supreme store owner James Jebbia also worked with MOB and carried the brand’s tees in his stores.  MOB's hands bikini with graffiti artist Kaws was a stepping-stone for Leah's company. With the suit's handprints boldly placed on every guy’s favorite spots on a girl’s body, this product is one of the more renowned MOB collabs. Various collabs followed in 2007, notably with the German accessory house MCM and a MOB x Kangol cashmere beanie.   Leah's love for France got her to meet graffiti artist Fafi, who helped design and model for the 07 Spring/Summer campaign. French avant-garde boutique Colette (boutique) collaborated successfully with MOB on Reebok lip print sneakers that sold out online in 23 minutes.  MOB teamed up with Nike in November 08 on a white tweed and black patent dunk. The MOB girls dropped a denim line as well as cut and sew for Winter 08. February 09 brought KRINK inks and MOB together, and they co-branded a Valentine's Day pack.    In Spring 09, the first wave of the collection was a collaboration with Chicago rapper, Kid Sister.  MOB's second wave of Spring 09 had the brand working with artist Jessy Kennedy, aka The Nite Rider, who added her naughty illustrations to a classically controversial MOB shirt.  With the 50th Anniversary of Barbie in March 09, Colette (boutique) continued its relationship with MOB with a commemorative tee.         ==Seen and Heard==   Married to the MOB (clothing) has been seen on many musicians and celebrities alike.  The line has been worn by rapper Uffie,  multi-talented artist Fergie (singer), singer Lady Gaga, model Doutzen Kroes, musician Kid Sister, and rapper Lady Sovereign.    ==MOB Living==  Married to the MOB is more than a clothing line, it is your source for all things MTTM-related.

See the entry on Microsoft Office Open XML for an example of what is a better writeup, IMHO.  Keep the Standardization section to the basics of what, when and where, the type of summary info that should be upfront and easily found in an encylopedia entry.  Put the debates or other side issues in their own section.  Also, a comment by a member of OASIS does not necessarily reflect OASIS policy or even the majority view of the ODF TC.  It is just one person's opinions at one point in time.  The use of the word ``rushed`` needs to be subtantiated, otherwise it is merely opinion.  Since I can also point to opinions on the web that say that ODF was not rushed, I think we'll both need to acknowledge that this is a debatable point, and either both sides of the argument should be presented, or an unadorned statement of the facts presented.  If we want to state the facts, we could mentioned when the ODF specification started standardization (December 2002), when comments on the lack of spreadsheet formulas were brought up (February 2005) and when the OASIS standard was issued (May 2005).  Was this a sign of rushing?  Or was it merely the case that it was too late in the ODF 1.0 process to take on this additional work?  It is certainly possible for the later to be true without the former.  2+ years for a standard is not typically evidence of rushing.   In any case, my vote would be to move this item to its own section, or perhaps to Standard office document formats debate.  Regards,      `",False

I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.

I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it.  ::It is done on children without their consent.

They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact. :: What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.   :: I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to. :: Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define ``circumcision`` would ask the question, ``which type? Male or female?`` In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.

318691626,"`   === Russian Jewish immigrants ``seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage`` ===   The influx of refugees, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil.   Although this sounds very nice, this is just wishfull-thinking and a lack of knowlegde of the reallity of the russian-jewish german immigration.  To further explain my point, I'll use a bit from the Germany Talk page:   ..., that during the last years more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel as they, usually Ashkenazies, feel much closer to Germany and the German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language) than to Israel. The Hebrew language is too much different from Yiddish and Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area, so an increasing number of Ashkenazies prefer emigrating to Germany where they feel more integrated     These kind of comments and insights are simply not true, are totally away from reality and show a profound lack of knowledge of current german/jewish life.  Good and reputable sources on this matter are abundant. I would suggest that you first start by readind the ``Juedische Allgemeine`` Germany's (internationally aclaimed) leading daily newspapers devoted to the jewish community. You'll find there lots of insights, analysis, studies, newsreports, and this will help you a lot to understand the reality of the Russian-Jewish post 90's emigration to Germany. Furthermore the german government policies, decisions and the impacto on german society have also been thouroughly  described, analysed and commentated on the main media press (Spiegel, etc) easly.    more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel or feel much closer to Germany  The reason number one for this preference is the exceptionally conditions (read money) that this german post-berlin-wall policy entitles them to. (much to the critic of the Israeli Governement)  Most of Russian who came, would never have left the ex Soviet Union, if it wasnt for this special german policy and the catastrophic collapse of pensions and social security in Russia. Not to Israel, not to anywhere. So it is incorrect to say ``preferred``. They just grabbed the opportunity. They neither feel closer to Germany nor to Israel. They feel and will continue to feel close to Russia, were they have already spent 2 thirds of their lives.    Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area   Most of the young, connected to Judaism, educated Russian Jews, have indeed by enlarge emigrated to Israel, Canada or the US. This started happening in the 1970s and peaked in the 90s     feel much closer to... German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language)  again this is nonsense, as the vast majority of these people have never spoke yiddish. They spoke Russian and are connected to the russian culture.     === `` ...a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil `` and Chabad Lubavitch ===   ... Chabad-Lubavitch ..opened this ...Chabad-Lubavitch ... ordained .that.. this and that   Chabad-Lubavitch opens and ordains all over the world. From Beijing to Antartica. And indeed more and more in the recent years. What I simply cannot understand is how come a minority (and extremly active) stream in modern Judaism can be representative of the ``.a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil``.   The issue of the ``renaissance`` with integration and participation of the ``russian jews`` in the german jewish community, their clashes and success stories is a well documented (and problematic one). Again, read the german (jewish and non jewish ) newspapers.  In their vast majority they were already above 50 when they arrived in Germany, and I would not say that their connection with judaism was/is ``that big``. Actually  because many of them are from mixed marriages, their offspring in Germany, no longer considers itself or has interest in their ``jewishness``.  The cornerstone of they identity is Russia, not Judaism. Again, read the german sources.    === ===`",False

The fact that the study did not find evidence of it is not evidence that cannibalism didn't occur. The only evidence they were looking for were cooked bones. If the cannibals simply sliced meat from a body there would be no lasting evidence. While we should mention the study, we shouldn't overplay it. -   ::Further comment: The Alder Creek digs of 2003-2004 do not ``cast doubt`` on Donner Party cannibalism. The archaeologists did not find evidence of cannibalism at Alder Creek, but this is easily explainable. Further, the Alder Creek digs say nothing about other incidents of cannibalism by Donner Party members at the lake camp, among the ``Forlorn Hope`` snowshoers, or at Starved Camp. Survivors said they ate human flesh and rescuers saw the evidence. Donner Party cannibalism is not in doubt among anyone who is familiar with the incident; it's the general public who have misinterpreted the archaeological evidence as ``casting doubt`` on cannibalism. DPL, 6/28/2007  Cannibalism in the Donner Party is not in question. Ten survivors said they ate human flesh. At the Donner family camp at Alder Creek, the Donners told the First Relief that they were going to start eating the bodies of the dead; when the Second Relief arrived at Alder Creek they saw children eating human flesh and mutilated corpses. Three Alder Creek survivors (Georgia Donner, Mary Donner, and Jean-Baptiste Trudeau) said that cannibalism had occurred at the Donner camp. This is not a legend, but a matter of record. People who are unfamiliar with the historical sources are not competent to dismiss them as ``legends.`` Kristin Johnson, author Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996).  As a little footnote I'd like to add that cannibalism WAS a big part of the story. The website that is footnoted on that sentence shows about 6 episodes of eating people. Some of them ate human flesh for a month! And even the site admits it's a ``brief`` section of their crazy feeding habits! Donner is forever known for eating others and the fact that it wasn't just 1 or 2 bodies, but like approx. 7-8+? really shows that these people had an appetite for homoerectus!     :As a little footnote, I'd like to add that you don't know what you're talking about. A year elapsed between the time the emigrants left home and the day the last survivor was rescued. With one exception, those who ate human flesh did so for about 2 weeks, some for as little as 2-3 days. Two weeks, out of 52 weeks in a year, IS minor. They did NOT ``develop an appetite for homo erectus`` or a ``crazy eating habit``  they put off eating human flesh for as long as they could, until finally there was absolutely nothing else left to eat. The reason why ``Donner is known forever for eating others`` is because the general public, like the commentator above, exults in its own ignorance.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by      I would like to point out they weren't eating homo erectus, but homo sapien. lol.

The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century?   Likewise, the term ``Palestine`` for the ``holyland`` was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus.

It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the ``English papacy.`` Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.``  ``Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors.

The article is making rounds all over the internet and has likely been read by hundreds of thousands, if not many more.  It'd be a great shame from my perspective if Ms. Glick's career suffered as a result of such charges (since they are, in my own personal view, baseless)such charges should be documented neutrally and weighed against the writings of Ms. Glick and her defenders, aiming only to inform the public, which can then decide.  When I inserted a reference arguing that Ms. Glick's positions are ``not racist`` but ``common sense,`` it was taken down by those same persons invoking BLP standards and undue weight.     `",False

This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing ``original research`` based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means ``a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process``.  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing ``original research``.  All we can say is ``Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.``  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say ``Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.``  There is still room to debate how reliable ``published author Y`` is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of ``Published author Y``.  The basic principle here is ``not published => not reliable``.  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09`",False

Taking into account that the full Patton's quote (``The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinese or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other amiable characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and they are all out sons-of-bitches, barbarians, and chronic drunks.``) has such a profound idea that ``good Russian is a dead Russian``, I see absolutely no use in this quote for the Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany talk page.

People don't understand the problem and people have also failed to communicate the problem to users who are just schoolboys. Many of them are simply not aware that prior to being named yadav they were registered as Ahir in british census. so, instead of bringing yadava rulers of the past they need to show Ahir Yadava connection. Here is MSA Rao's statement on the subject-``Historical & Semihistorical Evidences are available for equating Ahir with Yadava.`` . Boys you will do a great job if you just google, all the stuffs I had added in Ahir as Yadava section.   One important observation in this regard is All historical yadavas found till date has been traced to abhira ancestry. historical Yadavas story bigins with Trikuta(800AD), who were Abhira. There is a very long gap between Yadavas of mythical era and those historians have traced so this would always be a matter of debate, and this has nothing to do with the arrival date of Abhira, because most of Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata has been written between 6th and 8th century AD, and are suspected to be backward projection.   One important fact regarding Yadavas is that, though it means descent from Yadu, actually it means claiming Krishna lineage. Cult of krishna has no eveidence of existence before the beginning of the Christian era. so, dynasties had actually two kinds of claim, one from Krishna the God of Abhira, and another from Krishna the hero of Mahabharata. Again those who have adopted Krishna of Mahabharata did so only after it was written. These people are suspected to have styled on that line. There are Scholars(Check Rusell,B.V.) who believe Krishna of mahabharata is actually a cunning cruft of Brahmanas,and episodes related to him in Mahabharata are actually later days interpolations, done after stealing the god and philosophy of abhira tribe.  `",False

Otherwise, one might start to think that ``Old Testament`` translations, based upon the Greek Septaguint, are the authorities when in fact the Masoretic text of the Tanakh is considered by Jews the obvious standard.    :The term 'Bible' does not at all imply a later Christian source. It is a widely used term for the books considered canonical by Christians, that is not to say that they have a Christian origin. It is also a misunderstanding that translations based on the Septuagint are authoritative for Christians. Nearly all English Bible translations are in fact based on the Masoretic text. Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible. In any case, apart from a few fringe groups, Christians realize that the authority of any translation ultimately goes back to the original Hebrew (i.e. for the books of the Bible originally written in Hebrew of course).      ==Failure to contextualize==  The ``Construction`` section's 7th paragraph begins ``In 1967 Israel captured Old Jerusalem (and the Temple Mount) from Jordan.``  No other information is given about this; the impression is that Israel invaded Jordan without provocation, when in fact Israel's actions in the 1967 war were in response to a mass attack upon her by Arab countries, including Jordan, after Egypt's General Nasser and the other Arab States allied with Egypt had engaged in an act of war by closing down Israel's ability to ship through the Straits of Tiran with the express and stated purpose of annihilating Israel.

Also removed various distinctions between ``natural`` and ``synthetic``. There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.    Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.     What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.    Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.    As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.   :Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -    ::Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks.

I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with ``Vost``, ``ElliotJoyce``, or ``Accreditor``, and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me. Go back to being a Jew-wannabe sweety. Jews are white, not black. Remember that too- that's why you're not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish.

497455863,"`==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==  There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, ``The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School``. As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.    I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by      The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article.     They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  ``Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About    So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view?     I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), ``Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.``  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph.     The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its ``sister school`` for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.

497545517,"`  Hello.  I'm aware of that but I don't want to edit posts and get blocked again hence I'd like an advisor/mentor to guide me on here first so once I post it I wouldn't have any trouble.  For example ````. I wish to edit the page ``Muslim conquest of Persia`` and add these sections to them as they are historical facts.   ==Mass massacre and conversion== According to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) ``Zoroastrian`` families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.  Some historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.  It is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.  ==Persian rebellion==  Babak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.  Caliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).  Please share me your thoughts.   `",False

Is it anti-gay to say that marriage should be between one man and one woman, or anti-Semitic to say that the U.S. should end all foreign aid to Israel?  Or to keep a street named after a historical figure with a notable animosity to either group?  Your answer depends on who you are.

497590461,"`  == New 2012 study by Mark Regnerus, sociology professor at the University of Texas ==  A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy ``for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships`` - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.

Do we have to come to an ``agreement`` to put this information into the article itself? And if we don't, we will just ignore it and purposely leave the study out of the article, because somebody's opinion about it disagrees? This is not objective and completely unprofessional, not to mention biased. This is nothing more than intentionally leaving a study out of the article because somebody disagrees with the findings.  There is no valid, honest, objective reason to remove this information from the article, yet I was forced to open a ``talk`` about it because of no other reason than somebody not liking the results of the study.

Prior to mixing pens with test tubes as a science reporter, Spotts served as Midwest correspondent, staff editor in National News, special-projects editor, National News editor, and chief editorial writer. In 1987, Spotts shared an award with three Monitor colleagues for a series on the future of nuclear energy following the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl. In 2003, he received an American Association for the Advancement of Science's Science Journalism Award. He was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the 1999-2000 academic year and also received a two-week fellowship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France.  As a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy.

Predating all that is related below, the Pandava ancestors of Janjuas were known historically for the great Mahabharata war in which Arjuna and his brothers were victorious after huge losses on both sides.  ``The Janjua Rajputs possess a proud Martial reputation and rank very highly as the aristocracy of the Salt Range. Their pride in their ancestry is renowned and are always addressed by their ancestral title of Raja.`` (Rawalpindi District Gazetteer Robertson, reprint 2001, Lahore, p105)  ``Their (Janjuas) exploits and reputation has earned them the regard as the most Valiant Kshatriyas (warlords) in the Punjab.`` (History of Mediaeval Hindu India by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129) ``The tribal system of loyalty to the clan is still adhered, and they tend to only align with other tribes of equally high social rank and reputation.`` (The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia Gyanes Kudaisya, London 2000, p207) “The great Janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their Rájput title, and can be ranked as Míán Sáhu or first class Rájpúts...physically well-looking, with fine hands and feet; much given to military service, especially in the cavalry;...poor agriculturists, with great pride of race and are always addressed as Raja” (Panjab Castes - Sir Denzil Ibbetson, reprint Delhi 2002, p149, p154) ``The Janjua are famed as a restless and warlike Muslim Rājput tribe.`` (Imperial Gazetteer of Kashmir and Jammu, Sang e Meel, reprint 2002, p9, p34) and are ``doubtless pure Rājputs``.(Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p152) & (The Indian Village Community by Baden Henry Baden-Powell, Adamant Media Corp. 2005, p97) The Janjuas Rajputs have been recognised in Punjabi history as a 'Martial clan' and the British also viewed them as excellent soldiers and distinguished them from other tribes as``other tribes no way superior to them in courage or military skill``. ('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. . The ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..``as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said``. Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): ``We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing.`` Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: ``Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease``.  The Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a ``Rai Mal`` of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H. Griffin, in his famous book Chiefs and Families of note in the Punjab (Lahore, 1910, ii, p254) he writes that Raja Jodh and Raja Wir/Bhir (oldest sons of Rai Mal), ``divided the country, the Maloki Dhan, between them. Jodh took the Salt Range near about the Makrach and captured the town of Makshala from a colony of Brahmans...He changed its name to Makhiala and built there a fort and two tanks for rain water. Wir (also spelt Bhir), the eldest son of Raja Mal, took the possession of Kura (also spelt Khewra) near modern Pind Dadan Khan...`` [2]Raja Jodh son of Raja Mal fathered four sons: Raja Raepal (villages = Wagh , Chakri , Bajwala , Darapur, Sherpur, Pindi Saidpur, Fa",False

Example of the naivete and narrow scholarship of the article. First, the Bukharan Jews were almost entirely bereft of Jewish knowledge and practice by the 19th century, when they were missionized and ``restored`` by foreign Jewish emissaries. They had virtually no traditions. No one assumes a high level of culture in this remote area ``thousands`` of years ago. East-West trade began well into the Common Era, and Persian Jews in the silk-route trade probably established a trading colony here, as they did in Sinkiang/Kansu and Kaifeng (which were also defunct or highly assimilated by the early 19C). Secondly: ``Issachar`` is a very common surname or surname root among other Jews. It is so common, that it is one of the very few tribal names that has a nickname, usually ``sheik`` or a cognate form: eg Sheikowitz, Sikorski, Shack, etc.. Furthermore, some of these families (including my paternal-paternal line) have old traditions of descent from Issachar.

What do you guys think?:  A 2012 national telephone survey in English of a sample of 400 Iranian-Americans, commissioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans and conducted by Zogby Research Services, asked the respondents what their religions were.  The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, ``No response``: 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and ``Other``: 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.  Due to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.  There are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian.`",False

In regards to the consensus of Wikipedia editors, and I'm not referring to Flying Tiger, when Nishidani proposed that in the long run we discuss all aspects of Jimmu's memory from start to finish, including medieval and Tokugawa times, historiography, and popular culture, most users who commented agreed with that even though it's safe to say that no encyclopedias cover these last three things. It's certain that people in Japan made a clear link between Hakko Ichiu and Jimmu and if you had done a less restrictive book search, you would still have found no fewer than 430 English language sources noting this connection, including the reliable sources this article cites like Edwards, Dower, Earhart, Ruoff, and Brownlee. For instance, Emperor Hirohito evidently referred to Jimmu when he said ``It has been the great instruction bequeathed by Our Imperial Foundress (the Sun Goddess) and other Imperial Ancestors that our grand moral obligation should be extended to all directions and the world be unified under one roof.`` As historian James McClain notes ``As every Japanese schoolchild who had read Kokutai no Hongi knew by heart, hakko ichiu meant 'eight cords, one roof' and first appeared in the eighth-century chronicle Nihon Shoki.`` The association between Jimmu and Hakko Ichiu was extensively cultivated in wartime Japan, most scholars are aware of that, and it is highly relevant for Wikipedia purposes. Concerning our four sentences on Hakko Ichiu, for now I'd say we can shorten it to three if necessary, possibly deleting the sentence cited to Bix, but otherwise I see no reason or consensus to trim it back further than that. Frankly, as the article gradually expands there is even more that can be eventually noted here such as perhaps uchiteshi yamamu, the other wartime phrase attributed to Jimmu, or possibly Okawa Shumei's establishment of the Jimmu Society. The resurrection of the Jimmu propaganda machine in modern times does not need to be downplayed for fear of ``completely ignorant anti-Japanese POV-pushers``.

Science (from Latin scientia, meaning ``knowledge``) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.``... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.``—J. L. Heilbron ( )  * In an older and closely related meaning, ``science`` also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.  In modern usage, ``science`` may refer as well to a way of pursuing or producing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. Especially in the anglophone world ``science`` is often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.Oxford English Dictionary The German approach of ``Wissenschaften`` in the tradition of Humboldtian science and Humboldtian education ideal is more generic and includes all sort of scholarly endeavours with philosophy still as a common denominator. The The Two Cultures the German Positivism dispute and the US science wars refer to ongoing controversies about the role of natural sciences and the humanities. The controversies refered as well to the longstanding dominance of male White Anglo-Saxon Protestant scholars in e.g. US universities and the use of ``Dead white European men`` as role models. It has lead to various attempts, as in gender studies to involve e.g. female or minority perspectives in science and as well a backslash defending the important role of the classics.Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics (1993) (reprint, W.

686216164,"`  The first issue here is use of use of the word ``revealed`` religion, which was completely well sourced, but you have reverted (and again, you have also done some massive modifications without any consensus at all), to show some two theories. Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source, while I would provide several references below. But, before that, your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation.   From your own one source:  Page 78: ``...Guru Gobind Singh's work is best understood as the fulfillment of Guru Nanak's revelation. The Sikh organization had taken on the semblance of a State during...``  So your own source is describing it as ``Guru Nanak's revelation``. Now, my addition was well-sourced, and I can add here tens of other sources. But, I believe, at this point, there is no need to even share them, since your own source agrees with revelation.   Next, you keep quoting the sentence on ``not being Prophet, but illumined soul``. As per your own definition, ``Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations, believed to have come from God``. In this sense, since your own source says revelations, it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the ``non-Prophet`` aspect as reliable. Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words ``revelations`` and ``Prophets``. And further, again, even in your own source, when describing ``Guru``, the author quotes:  ``On account of his divine prerogative and attributes the Guru, though human in form, is godly in spirit. God speaks to humanity through him. God enlightens the seekers of truth through him and his word.``  The author also states, ``Guru Gobind Singh tells Bhai Nand Lal .... (Guru is) the Light which is eternally God and represents God's Being in pure form. It is because of the consummate perfection, that God is in the Guru and the Guru is in God.``   So, I have not even brought it any of the other 10s of sources, and your own single source is so weak (and on the contrary, it actually supports ``revelations``, ``God is in the Guru`` ``God speaks to humanity through him``). As I had said before, it is you who needs to get consensus before your massive unexplained edits that you keep performing.   And finally, as a general advice, the fact that Sikhs consider the Gurus to be direct messengers sent by God, and the Guru Granth Sahib to be the word of God, is one of the most  basic and fundamental beliefs in Sikhism.

691273245,"`  Lol, looks like  has decided the matter for himself. It's a false claim to him, therefore, it's a false claim. Lol.  I'd like to point out that this man, Antoni, is a Christian Nationalist, which is well-known for it's anti-Semitism, after the views of Martin Luther. Many modern KKK are Christian Nationalists, and are denounced as not being ``true Christians`` by most Christians, for their hatred. The Christian National Union that he adheres to is a part of the Christian right and social conservatives – making it more likely that they really are anti-Semetic. Plus, the label ``nationalism`` often comes with the disdain for ``others``. And, one of the sources is the Jerusalem Post – a very reliable source. Sounds like Reliable Ben is unreliable.  `",False
691520296,"`  ::Knowledgebattle certainly know that  just made a manipulative statement, when you said, ``ZChN does not exist.`` By simply saying, ``does not exist``, it leaves out the fact that it did, and that the political ideology still lingers. Racism didn't die in the US after the slaves were freed; the ZChN ideology doesn't die just because the party has all but disbanded. The party that many of them went on to, Polska Jest Najważniejsza, is in fact nationalist, as the name, itself, makes clear. And from there, Polska Razem. Being Rightist conservatives, it's no wonder he just made the same kind of comment that one would expect from Donald Trump: ``Everyone must realise how big a mistake it was to attempt to relocate groups of Muslim immigrants in Poland.`` When Christians bomb something or attack someone, no Christians assert that anyone should kick the Christians out of the country, or that it's a mistake to let Christians live in their country. The man is anti-Semetic (in regard toward both Jews and Muslims). He's making that very clear.  `",False
